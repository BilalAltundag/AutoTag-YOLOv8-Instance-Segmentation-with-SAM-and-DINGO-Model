# AutoTag-YOLOv8-Instance-Segmentation-with-SAM-and-DINGO-Model
AutoTag-YOLOv8 is an object detection project that uses the YOLOv8 model and leverages the power of SAM and DINGO models for automatic labeling. This repository provides the code and resources needed to train the YOLOv8 model using custom datasets, and perform automatic labeling on images using the SAM and DINGO models.
